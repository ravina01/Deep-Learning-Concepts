Everything you need to know about how Neural Net works!

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which itself is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). It involves training neural networks with many layers (hence the term "deep") to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. Here's an overview of deep learning and the typical steps involved in building and training a deep learning model:

### What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning models are inspired by the structure and function of the brain, specifically neural networks. These models learn to perform tasks by being exposed to large amounts of data and iteratively improving their performance. Key characteristics of deep learning include:

#### 1. Neural Networks: 
Composed of layers of nodes (neurons), each layer transforms the input data, progressively extracting higher-level features.
####  2. Automatic Feature Extraction: 
Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning models can automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection.
####  3. Large Scale: 
Deep learning models often require large datasets and substantial computational power for training.

### Steps in Building a Deep Learning Model

#### 1. Data Collection:
- Gather a large and diverse dataset relevant to the task.
- Ensure the data is labeled if the task is supervised learning.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing:
- Cleaning: Remove noise and handle missing values.
- Normalization: Scale features to a similar range.
- Augmentation: Create more data by transformations (e.g., flipping, rotation for images).
- Splitting: Divide data into training, validation, and test sets.

#### 3. Model Selection:
- Choose an appropriate neural network architecture (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for images, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequences).
- Determine the number of layers, type of layers (dense, convolutional, recurrent), and other hyperparameters.

#### 4. Model Architecture Design:
- Define the model's architecture using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras).
- Specify the input shape, layer types, activation functions, and the output layer.

#### 5. Compilation:
- Select a loss function appropriate for the task (e.g., cross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression).
- Choose an optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD) to update the model parameters.
- Define metrics to evaluate the model's performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

#### 6. Training:
- Feed the training data into the model in batches.
- Perform forward and backward propagation to update the weights.
- Use the validation set to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
- Adjust hyperparameters if necessary (hyperparameter tuning).

#### 7. Evaluation:
- Assess the model's performance on the test set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
- Analyze metrics and create confusion matrices, ROC curves, or other visualizations to understand performance.

#### 8. Fine-Tuning and Optimization:
- Make adjustments to the model architecture or hyperparameters based on evaluation results.
- Apply techniques like dropout, batch normalization, or learning rate scheduling to improve performance.

#### 9. Deployment:
- Integrate the trained model into an application or service.
- Ensure the model can handle real-world data and scales appropriately.

### Key Concepts in Deep Learning:

#### 1. Activation Functions:
Functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh introduce non-linearity into the model.
#### 2. Loss Functions: 
Quantify how well the model's predictions match the true labels.
#### 3. Optimizers: 
Algorithms that adjust the model weights to minimize the loss function (e.g., Adam, RMSprop).
#### 4. Regularization: 
Techniques to prevent overfitting, such as dropout and L2 regularization.
#### 5. Batch Size: 
Number of samples processed before the model's internal parameters are updated.
#### 6. Epochs: 
One full pass through the entire training dataset.

Activation functions play a crucial role in neural networks by introducing non-linearity, allowing the model to learn complex patterns and representations. They determine the output of a neural network's node given an input or set of inputs. Let's delve into the details of different activation functions, their types, and specific use cases in computer vision applications.


#### a. Sigmoid
The sigmoid function maps any input to a value between 0 and 1. It is represented as:

Pros:
- Smooth gradient, preventing abrupt changes in direction during optimization.
- Output range between 0 and 1, useful for probabilistic interpretations.

Cons:
- Can cause vanishing gradient problems.
- Not zero-centered, leading to slower convergence.
  
Use Case:
- Used in the output layer of binary classification problems.
- Historically used in hidden layers, but less common now due to better alternatives.


#### b. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)
The tanh function maps inputs to values between -1 and 1. It is represented as:

- Smoother gradient compared to sigmoid.

Cons:
- Can still suffer from the vanishing gradient problem.

Use Case:
- Used in hidden layers of neural networks, especially in RNNs.


#### c. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
The ReLU function outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero:

#### d. Leaky ReLU
A variation of ReLU that allows a small, non-zero gradient when the input is negative:

#### e. Parametric ReLU (PReLU)
Similar to Leaky ReLU, but the slope of the negative part is learned during training:

#### f. Softmax
The softmax function converts logits into probabilities, summing to 1. It is represented as:

#### Stage of Deep Learning Where Activation Functions are Used

Activation functions are used after each layer of a neural network to introduce non-linearity. This is crucial for the model to learn complex patterns. The specific stage is:

- Input Layer: No activation function is used here.
- Hidden Layers: Activation functions like ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and tanh are applied to introduce non-linearity.
- Output Layer: Activation functions like Softmax or Sigmoid are used to produce the final output, depending on the task.
